# 2_body: no_initial_velocity

In this test case, the initial condition has two particles with no initial velocities.

To get the trajectory of the particles, as shown in **Fig. 3 (left)** in the project report, just **run the "run_script" using the command "./run_script" in the terminal**. It will run the simulation and give the required image as **"position_track.png"**.


Other commands for more specific actions:
* If you want to just run the simulations, the outputs are stored in "output" directory: $ python3 run.py 
* If you want to just plot projected positions the outputs, saved in "Plots" directry  : $ python3 plotter.py 
* If you want to just plot the trajectory of the particles as "position_track.png"     : $ python3 plotter_track.py 
* If you want to just make a video from the Plots made using plotter.py                : $ ./video.txt
